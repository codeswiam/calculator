# calculator

Because everyone has to make one at some point.

- Basic arithmetic operations.
- No BODMAS or PEMDAS, each pair of numbers gets evaluated at a time from left to right. 
- Math and Syntax Error implemented.
- Note to self: horrible script for the decimal point it doesn't work in some cases. redo the whole thing when you have the time.
